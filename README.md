# ReSe

TL;DR: ReSe is a web ui for one of my course projects. It is a simple web ui for remote sensing object detection.

This website is powered by [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/) and [ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/). And it completes all calculations entirely on the client side. So, you can use it without any privacy concerns.
